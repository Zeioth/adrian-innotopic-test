# Base project

This is an angular+apollo+graphql example that performs CRUD operations.



# How to run

    cd Client
    npm install
    npm start

    cd Server
    npm install
    npm start

Now you can visit:

* http://localhost:4200/webpack-dev-server/
* http://localhost:4000/



Problems encountered: It doesn't actually perform CRUD yet because I have to solve some bootstrap/jquery issue. But every part of the skeleton project skeleton should be there.
